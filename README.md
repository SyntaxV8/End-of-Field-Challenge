# End-of-Field-Challenge

This was an exercise where we needed to make 2 interfaces, a simple (https://quirky-stonebraker-359ef7.netlify.app) and a complex (https://distracted-shirley-64b990.netlify.app) one.

The Simple one went really easy but the complex one gave me some troubles with the buttons on the bottom of the cards and the border-bottom in the job-description.
With a lot of googling and tutorials I fixed the buttons but the border-bottom problem is still a little bit a mystery. I know you can fix it with setting the div to absolute so it overwrites the parent element's padding but I was in a litte bit of time need.
